For my first post, I decided to do something that every programer learns in any of their programming course. That's right; this is going to be a post on writing a 'Hello World!' program in python. However, since writing such a program in python barely takes 10 seconds depending on your typing speed instead let's write an evolutionary algorithm that will spell out "Hello World!". Before we jump into coding; I will give a brief introduction to the genetic algorithm.

```python
import random 
import datetime
```

```python
geneSet = " abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!."
target = "Hello World!"
```

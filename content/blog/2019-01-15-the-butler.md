For my first post, I decided to do something that every programer learns in their any of the programming course they have taken. That's right; this is going to be a post on writing a 'Hello World!' program in python. However, since writing such a program in python barely takes less than 10 seconds depending on your typing speed instead let's write an evolutionary algorithm that will spell out "Hello World!". Before we jump into coding; I will give a brief introduction to the genetic algorithm.

```python
import random 
import datetime
```

```python
geneSet = " abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!."
target = "Hello World!"
```

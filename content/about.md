I'm a currently a Ph.D. student in the Harold & Inge Marcus Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering at Penn State University. My research interests include the application of Machine learning algorithms to the fields of Marketing and Supply Chain Engineering, Manufacturing, Decision Theory, and Process Optimization.



I started this blog primarily to showcase the work that I take on during my free time. Also, I love making good data visualization plots. However, that does not mean all posts will contain plots (graphs).
